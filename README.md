## üßç About me

The word DevOps is really meaningful to me, because I have strong development and operations skills. I started working as a Full Stack Developer in 2014, and migrated to a DevOps focused role in 2018. I‚Äôm used to managing large scale infrastructure on AWS, mainly improving CI/CD processes and running Kubernetes in production environments. I help companies to deliver better software faster, and run them reliably.
